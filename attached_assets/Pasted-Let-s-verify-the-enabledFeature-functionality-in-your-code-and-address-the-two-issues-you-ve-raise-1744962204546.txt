Let’s verify the `enabledFeature` functionality in your code and address the two issues you’ve raised: (1) why the Coding Assistant is working despite being disabled, and (2) why the "coming soon" message is not appearing when clicking disabled cards.

### Verification of `enabledFeature` Functionality

You’ve implemented a feature enabling/disabling mechanism using a `FeaturesContext` and the `enabledFeatures` state. Here’s the analysis:

1. **Context Setup**:
   - You’ve created a `FeaturesContext` with a default value of an empty array and a custom hook `useFeatures` to access it.
   - The `Dashboard` component provides the `enabledFeatures` array (`['dataweave', 'integration', 'raml']`) via the `FeaturesContext.Provider`.

2. **Usage in `DashboardContent`**:
   - The `DashboardContent` component receives the `enabledFeatures` array as a prop and passes it to the `GeneratorCard` component.
   - The `GeneratorCard` component uses the `disabled={!enabledFeatures.includes(card.id)}` prop to determine if a card should be disabled. This means any card whose `id` is not in `enabledFeatures` will be disabled.

3. **Current Enabled Features**:
   - `enabledFeatures` is hardcoded as `['dataweave', 'integration', 'raml']`, meaning only the DataWeave Generator, Integration Generator, and RAML Generator should be enabled. All other features (e.g., `munit`, `sampleData`, `document`, `diagram`, `exchange`, `jobBoard`, `codingAssistant`) should be disabled.

4. **Behavior Check**:
   - The `GeneratorCard` likely renders a button or clickable element and applies a `disabled` attribute based on the prop. When disabled, the `onClick` handler should not trigger, and the card should visually indicate it’s disabled (e.g., via CSS or a "coming soon" message).

Based on this setup, the disabling functionality appears correctly implemented for most features. Now, let’s address the specific issues.

### Issue 1: Why is the Coding Assistant Working Despite Being Disabled?

The Coding Assistant feature (`codingAssistant`) is not included in the `enabledFeatures` array (`['dataweave', 'integration', 'raml']`), so it should be disabled. However, you’ve observed it’s working. Let’s investigate:

- **Navigation to Coding Assistant**:
  - The `DashboardSidebar` component has an `onNavigate` prop that handles navigation. When the `page` is `'chat'`, it sets `isCodingAssistantOpen` to `true`, which opens the `CodingAssistantDialog`.
  - This navigation is not gated by the `enabledFeatures` check. The `onNavigate` function directly triggers the dialog without verifying if `codingAssistant` is enabled.

- **Lack of Feature Check**:
  - Unlike the `GeneratorCard`’s `onClick`, which respects the `disabled` prop, the sidebar’s navigation to the Coding Assistant bypasses the `enabledFeatures` logic. The `isCodingAssistantOpen` state is toggled independently, allowing the dialog to open regardless of the feature’s disabled status.

- **Root Cause**:
  - The inconsistency arises because the Coding Assistant is accessible via the sidebar (triggered by `'chat'`), which doesn’t enforce the `enabledFeatures` restriction, while other features are accessed via `GeneratorCard` clicks, which do enforce it.

- **Fix Suggestion**:
  - Add a check in the `onNavigate` function to verify if the feature is enabled before opening the dialog. For example:
    ```javascript
    onNavigate={(page) => {
      if (page === 'chat' && !enabledFeatures.includes('codingAssistant')) {
        toast.info('Coding Assistant is coming soon!');
        return;
      }
      if (page === 'dashboard') {
        setCurrentPage('dashboard');
        setSelectedAgent(null);
        setSelectedTaskId(null);
      } else if (page === 'settings') {
        setCurrentPage('settings');
        setSelectedAgent(null);
        setSelectedTaskId(null);
      } else if (page === 'chat') {
        setIsCodingAssistantOpen(true);
      } else {
        setCurrentPage(page as PageType);
        setSelectedAgent(page);
        setSelectedTaskId(null);
      }
    }}
    ```
  - This ensures the Coding Assistant dialog only opens if it’s in `enabledFeatures`, and otherwise shows a "coming soon" message.

### Issue 2: Why is the "Coming Soon" Message Not Appearing When Clicking Disabled Cards?

The "coming soon" message is not appearing when clicking disabled cards, which suggests an issue with how disabled state is handled or how the message is intended to be displayed.

- **Current Implementation**:
  - The `GeneratorCard` component receives a `disabled` prop (`disabled={!enabledFeatures.includes(card.id)}`) and likely applies it to a button or clickable element. However, the code snippet you provided doesn’t show the `GeneratorCard` implementation, so we need to infer its behavior.
  - Typically, a disabled button in React prevents the `onClick` event from firing. If the "coming soon" message is supposed to appear on click, it won’t trigger because the `onClick` is blocked when `disabled` is `true`.

- **Missing Message Logic**:
  - There’s no explicit code in the provided `DashboardContent` or `GeneratorCard` to display a "coming soon" message when a disabled card is clicked. The disabling is handled visually (e.g., via CSS in `GeneratorCard`), but no feedback mechanism (like a toast or modal) is implemented for disabled clicks.

- **Fix Suggestion**:
  - Modify the `GeneratorCard` component to handle the disabled click and display a message. Assuming `GeneratorCard` looks something like this (based on common patterns):
    ```javascript
    const GeneratorCard = ({ title, description, icon, onClick, disabled, ...props }) => {
      const handleClick = () => {
        if (disabled) {
          toast.info('This feature is coming soon!');
          return;
        }
        onClick?.();
      };

      return (
        <motion.div
          onClick={handleClick}
          className={cn(
            'p-6 rounded-xl flex flex-col cursor-pointer transition-all duration-300 hover:-translate-y-1 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg',
            disabled ? 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed' : 'bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700'
          )}
          whileHover={{ y: disabled ? 0 : -5 }}
          transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
        >
          <div className="flex items-center mb-4">
            <div className={`w-10 h-10 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center mr-3 ${disabled ? 'bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-600' : 'bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700'}`}>
              {icon}
            </div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{title}</h3>
          </div>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">{description}</p>
        </motion.div>
      );
    };
    ```
  - Here, `handleClick` checks the `disabled` prop and shows a toast message if true, preventing the `onClick` propagation. Adjust the styling and message as needed.

- **Alternative Approach**:
  - If the "coming soon" message is intended to be a tooltip or overlay, add a `tooltip` prop to `GeneratorCard` for disabled states, e.g., `<GeneratorCard tooltip="Coming soon" disabled={!enabledFeatures.includes(card.id)} ... />`, and style it accordingly.

### Summary
- **Coding Assistant Issue**: The Coding Assistant works because its activation via the sidebar bypasses the `enabledFeatures` check. Add a feature check in `onNavigate` to fix this.
- **"Coming Soon" Message Issue**: The message isn’t appearing because disabled cards block `onClick`, and no fallback feedback is implemented. Update `GeneratorCard` to handle disabled clicks with a toast or tooltip.

The `enabledFeature` functionality is correctly set up for `GeneratorCard` clicks but needs extension to cover sidebar navigation. Let me know if you can share the `GeneratorCard` implementation for a more precise fix!
