## Special Instructions

1. If the request includes RAML, use APIKit to generate the router and implement each endpoint
2. For database operations, use the Database connector
3. For file operations, use the File connector
4. For SOAP services, use the Web Service Consumer
5. For REST APIs, use the HTTP Requester
6. Use proper exception strategies and error handling
7. Make sure to use DataWeave for all transformations

Generate complete, production-ready Mule code that follows all best practices and includes proper error handling.
